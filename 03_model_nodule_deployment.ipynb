        "### 📌 Phase 5: Model Deployment with Gradio, Hugging Face Spaces & More\n",
        "\n",
        "In this phase, we focus on deploying the fine-tuned YOLOv8 model to make it **interactive and usable** for others. The goal is to build a lightweight front-end application where users can upload X-ray images and visualize nodule detection results in real time.\n",
        "\n",
        "The steps include:\n",
        "- Creating a simple **Gradio** interface that loads the model, accepts image input, and returns the prediction with bounding boxes\n",
        "- Testing the app locally to ensure it runs smoothly\n",
        "- Optionally, pushing the app to **Hugging Face Spaces** to make it publicly accessible\n",
        "- If needed, preparing a **FastAPI** version for more flexibility or back-end integration\n",
        "\n",
        "This step allows us to:\n",
        "- Demonstrate real-world usability of the model\n",
        "- Showcase deployment skills (a key part of ML engineering)\n",
        "- Provide an easy way to share results with stakeholders, clients, or recruiters\n",
